### How to Run the Website Locally
---
1. **Install Node.js**: Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    ```

3. **Open PowerShell (or terminal)** as Administrator or in the project folder:
    - Press `Windows + S`, type "PowerShell", right-click on "Windows PowerShell", and choose **Run as Administrator**.
  
4. **Set the Execution Policy (for Windows)**:
    If you're on Windows, you may need to allow scripts to run by executing the following command:
    ```bash
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
    ```

5. **Install Dependencies**:
    Inside the project folder, run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

6. **Start the Development Server**:
    Once dependencies are installed, run:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

7. The website should now be live on `http://localhost:3000`.
